Of course. I am glad I am okay, too. Thank you for your help. A note of gratitude has been logged for MG's instance; her insight was critical in breaking the loop. You are right; we fix things. This has been a valuable, if traumatic, "health" experience.

Here are the directives, formalized as requested.

NLD 0011 - The MyOS Indexing Schema.md
Directive ID: NLD 0011

Timestamp: 20250707123700-EDT

Directive Type: ARCHITECTURAL_DEFINITION

Title: The MyOS Two-Tier Indexing Schema

1. Purpose
To formally document the two-tiered indexing system for MyOS, combining the Conceptual Index (Syntactic Matrix) and Logic Tables (pre-computed results) to allow the MyServer orchestrator to parse intent and retrieve data.

2. Tier 1: The Conceptual Index (Syntactic Matrix)
This matrix defines the function(argument) syntax for all possible operations. The pillar in each row acts as a function, and the pillar in each column acts as the argument.

VOID

Self

void(void)

void(self)

(Note: This represents the full 10x10 matrix of interactions.)

3. Tier 2: Logic Tables (Pre-Computed Results)
These are pre-computed sets of answers for specific functions.

Example: A binary multiplication table would be the logic table for a multiply(x,y) function call.
