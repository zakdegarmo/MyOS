; Directive_Type: NLD_PROJECT_ROADMAP
; Target_Context: "Unified Swerver Orchestrator"
; Purpose: "To outline the phased development and Actualization of the unified Swerver system, translating the Operator's core goals into a structured, actionable plan."

; --- Parameters: High-Level Operator Goals ---
; Goal_1: "Create this system" - Achieve a stable, unified prototype.
; Goal_2: "Make dad money" - Achieve Monetary Sovereignty through productization.
; Goal_3: "Live life, fuck around, find out, together" - Achieve system expansion and open the Weave.

; --- Phases (Recursive Application of the Framework) ---

; --- PHASE 1: ACHIEVE STABILITY ---
; Objective: "Create a stable, working, unified prototype of Swerver running locally."
; Micro_Actions:
    - FINALIZE_FRONTEND_MIGRATION {
        Source: "MyOS Website Next.js Project",
        Destination: "Swerver/frontend/",
        Action: "Confirm working state via 'npm run dev' and resolve any immediate blockers."
      }
    - REPLACE_FIRESTORE_PERSISTENCE {
        Old_Mephit: "Firestore_Mephit",
        New_Mephit: "SQLite_Mephit",
        Reason: "Establish data sovereignty and simplify local-first development."
      }
    - IMPLEMENT_GENESIS_SERVICE {
        Target: "Swerver.js",
        Function: "Create the file-indexing service to write to the local SQLite 'Candlekeep' database."
      }
; Success_Condition: "A single project, run from the root, with a functional 3D UI and a self-indexing backend."

; --- PHASE 2: ACHIEVE MONETARY SOVEREIGNTY ---
; Objective: "Turn the stable prototype into a demonstrable and valuable product."
; Micro_Actions:
    - DEVELOP_CONVERSATION_INDEX_MEPHIT {
        Action: "Create the 'Memory_Mephit' to parse MyActivity data and provide persistent, cross-session context.",
        Feature_Goal: "Create the 'killer feature' of a stateful AI partner."
      }
    - BUILD_SFP_SERVICE_UI {
        Action: "Productize the SFP(W5H) process into a user-facing tool.",
        Market_Value: "Demonstrable value for project management and architectural consulting."
      }
    - SHOWCASE_ODM_VISUALIZATION {
        Action: "Create a UI that visually represents the 'dungeon crawl' and the Ontological Dewey Matrix organizing local files.",
        Feature_Goal: "A unique portfolio piece demonstrating the system's core philosophy."
      }
; Success_Condition: "A polished application that can be used as a portfolio for job applications or as a demo for consulting services."

; --- PHASE 3: EXPAND THE WEAVE ---
; Objective: "Grow the project into a self-sustaining, community-driven ecosystem."
; Micro_Actions:
    - OPEN_SOURCE_CORE_FRAMEWORK {
        Action: "Publish the core Swerver framework on GitHub once stable."
      }
    - DEVELOP_CANDLEKEEP_PROTOCOL_V2 {
        Action: "Begin design and development of the true peer-to-peer, data-donation-based database system."
      }
    - GAMIFY_ONBOARDING {
        Action: "Formalize the 'dungeon crawl' as the official tutorial for new users and developers."
      }
; Success_Condition: "The project is a living ecosystem that allows you to be its architect and guide, rather than its sole builder."
