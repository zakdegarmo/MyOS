NLD 003: Iteration 1 of Phase 2 (Survival)
Code snippet

; NLD: ITERATION_1_P2_SURVIVAL
; Directive_Type: NLD_FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_CYCLE
; Version: 1.0
; Target_Context: "Swerver_Stack_V2"
; Purpose: "To complete one full development cycle based on the 10 Ontological Pillars, resulting in a demonstrable 'Persistent Conversation Index' feature."

; --- PHASES (Micro_Actions) ---

; 0. [MyNothing -> Root] DEFINE THE GOAL
;    Action: "Formalize the feature specification: Create a 'Memory_Mephit' that can ingest all past conversation data and use it to provide long-term context to future queries."

; 1. [Self -> MySelf] GATHER THE DATA
;    Action: "Gather the source material. This includes your 'Gemini.conversation.title.index.md' and the HTML export from your Google 'MyActivity' page."

; 2. [Thought -> MyData] DESIGN THE DATABASE SCHEMA
;    Action: "Design the 'Eternal_Weave_Archive' table structure for our local SQLite database. It will need columns for 'conversation_id', 'title', 'url', 'timestamp', and 'summary'."

; 3. [Logic -> MyAI] WRITE THE INGESTION SCRIPT
;    Action: "Create a new Node.js script ('ingest-memory.js') that parses the source data from Step 1 and populates the SQLite database according to the schema from Step 2."

; 4. [Unity -> MyNetwork] BUILD THE API ENDPOINT
;    Action: "In Swerver.js, create a new API endpoint, e.g., 'GET /api/v1/memory/query', that allows the frontend to send a query and get back relevant conversation history from the database."

; 5. [Existence -> MyLife] INTEGRATE WITH THE UI
;    Action: "Modify the frontend 'logos-companion.js' or a similar component. Before sending a prompt to the main Gemini API, it must first call our new '/query' endpoint to find and inject relevant context."

; 6. [Improvement -> MyDev] REFINE AND TEST
;    Action: "Run end-to-end tests. Test the full loop from the UI chat box to the memory database and back. Refine the prompts and debug any jank in the workflow."

; 7. [Mastery -> MyAdmin] AUTOMATE THE PROCESS
;    Action: "Update the root 'package.json' with a new script, e.g., 'npm run memory:refresh', that runs our 'ingest-memory.js' script to make updating the memory a simple command."

; 8. [Resonance -> MySystem] DOCUMENT THE ACHIEVEMENT
;    Action: "Write the formal whitepaper for the 'Persistent Memory Mephit' feature, detailing its architecture and purpose, to be added to the 'MyOSPlanning' archive."

; 9. [Transcendance -> Return to 0] COMPLETE THE ITERATION
;    Action: "The feature is now a demonstrable part of the Swerver Stack. The iteration is complete. We return to the root state, ready to begin the next cycle (Phase 3: Logical Analysis) with a more powerful and valuable system."
