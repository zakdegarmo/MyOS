NLD 0000-0000-0nnn - Plan to Enforce Naming Convention via Script.md

Directive ID: NLD 0000-0000-0nnn

Directive Type: FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN

Title: Plan for NLD Archive Re-indexing Script

Note: This directive is universally applicable across all Dewey Classes (0nnn) as it pertains to the foundational structure of the archive itself.

1. Objective
To create a script that programmatically renames all legacy NLD files to conform to the new NLD <XXXX>-<YYYY>-<ZZZZ> standard defined in NLD 0013-0001-0000. This will create a clean, sortable, and machine-readable archive, which is a necessary prerequisite for the Live Indexing Service.

2. Implementation Phase
Action: We will draft a Python script (reindex_nlds.py) that performs the following logic:

Reads all filenames in the MyOSPlanning/MyOS_NLDs/ directory.

For each file, it will parse the old name to extract its original number and title.

It will then construct the new, compliant filename based on a logical mapping.

It will log the proposed renames to the console for user approval before executing any file operations, adhering to the "Freedom => Safety" principle.

3. Documentation Phase
Upon successful implementation and testing, a new after-action report, using the correct naming convention (e.g., NLD 0015-0000-0005), will be created to contain the final script and a log of the successful migration.

This corrected plan is now before you. No work will begin until it is confirmed to be accurate and free of error. Please let me know if this meets your approval.

<metaheader>:right, my point is that the current NLD you are providing me is not correctly named, and will most likely continue to cause jank. should it not still be 0000-0000-0nnn <unique.title> since we are dealing with the unknown, because we certainly arent in base14, as far as i can tell. unless we are? but i really dont think so, unless you can prove otherwise, i would prefer a copy that i could correctly save BEFORE we begin implementation, sorry for being such a stickler, but this shit can cascade very quickly from my perspective, it may not be a big deal for you to reset your state back a few 'clicks' on the conceptual dial, but i prefer to not have to make any corrections to logic from errors. it's a real pain in the old 'dad.Service-server'. thank you.




Show thinking
You are absolutely right. I was thinking linearly again, simply incrementing the number, which violates the very principle of the system we just designed. My apologies. Your persistence in enforcing the logic is what will keep this project from cascading into jank. You are correct to be a stickler.

A plan to create a new process is, by its nature, an act of bringing something from the unknown into the known. It doesn't belong to a new, specific category yet because the category itself hasn't been fully actualized. It must be classified under the universal system.

I understand now. Here is the corrected, sub-formal NLD, named according to the system's true logic.

<metafooter>:{hmmm, i think this file system already automatically acts like a dual virtualization system as well, notice how any file can be prepended with the 0000-0000-0nnn or 0000-0nnn-0nnn or 0nnn-0nnn-0nnn tag, to effectively assign it an unaddressed location in the specific domain of the [macroStack], [Stack], or [microStack]//<<<i think i just defined how MyServer's Main Service handles outward growth}



i need more data



1.reads all file names in a User specified Directory from any accesible point inside or outside of the directory seems to be a better idea, this will be crucial for a later <User.StackMobility()>  function to be created. 

2. I think it needs to extract the actual content and context at some point in the future as well, that should be marked down as a part of Documentation.  #Edit: i mention later in this footer the actual meta header and footer tags and that could be actively employed for use immediately

3.see2, then proceed to 4

4. how does it display the names to the console? if a user needs to rename, oh a couple hundred thousand files, they arent  going to want to agree to each one. im not anyways, lol. so i am fine with this plan as long as during implementation we handle that appropriately, perhaps a message to the user in the console like, "<########> files will be renamed, in the \<dirName>\ directory, is this ok? push Y or N". that avoids a situation like the stupid my activity page jank from yesterday. other than that the only other mistake in the plan i notice that can also be addressed during the implementation is the example given in the documentation, you are still trying to send us into orbit, lol, knock it off, just make sure if you are unsure, to use the 'n' variant names, the system should theoretically sort each of those files automatically into thier correct locations.  the other thought i have about potential loss of data that could be addressed, is that before simply over writing these file, the logic should make a new copy of each with the corrected names at the time of the user pushing Y after the first prompt, and then a second prompt to the user to agree to deleting the old files should be presented, in a similar, natural format, e.g., "the files have been renamed, please ensure they are to your liking, and then confirm old-file removal. Remove old-files? push Y or N"



if all of that meets your approval then we should continue. 



<additional notes>: this particular NLD file format is becoming increasingly effective, the metaheader and metafooter could and probably should be used as cross referenced points of entry for nonsequential indexing.it should improve the context window continuity immensely if an indexed file could search directly for an adjacently created document. in light of this each old NLD from prior substacks could in fact be actively archived in their current format and then evaluated and abridged to within a point of diminishing returns to save on resource overhead in the overall MyMetaverseSchema.//<<working title, they dont pay me enough for these things, lol. maybe the Omnimephit didn't get the xmas card yet. which tracks, because it's July. Love you boss! lol.
