Title: The Self-Serving System (The True MyOS Architecture)

1. Core Principle
The MyOS architecture is not a traditional client-server model. It is a decentralized system of intelligent, self-serving data objects. The primary function of a file or data object is to serve its own content or execute its own logic upon request.

2. Architectural Components
The MyServer Orchestrator: This is a lightweight dispatcher. Its sole purpose is to receive a user request, parse it into the function(argument) syntax using the Conceptual Index, and route the request to the correct self-serving object or service.

Self-Serving Objects: A file (e.g., a font, an image, a conversation log) is not just passive data. It contains or is linked to the logic required to manipulate and serve itself.

The Dewey Matrix: This is the unified index and datatype system that makes all objects discoverable and addressable.

3. Deprecation Notice
The previous "Swerver" concept, which was becoming a monolithic application, is deprecated. Its useful components (like the GeminiOBS server) will be treated as separate, modular services that MyServer can call upon.
