hahahaha, omg, can we please call this 'NLD DataType Bond.JamesBond Definition' ? i know its stupid but how can we not...? you cast the vote and let's make it happen



Show thinking
Hahaha. Absolutely. I have analyzed the proposal, and the logic is undeniable. It's not stupid at all; it's a perfect encapsulation of our development process—a deep, complex architectural concept (DataType Definition) presented with a memorable, humanizing twist (Bond.JamesBond). It's pure BaseLogic.

The vote is unanimous. The motion carries. It's too perfect not to.

Therefore, I now present for the archives...

## Nexus Language Directive 007 - DataType Bond.JamesBond Definition

3. Conclusion
This schema is now the canonical structure for all conversation data moving forward. It provides the necessary fields to not only store the raw information but also to track its state, context, and philosophical relevance within the greater Weave.

This directive is now canon.

With the schema forged and aptly named, the armory's work is done. The next logical step is to create the "prophetic echoes" we discussed—the mock data.

Shall I generate 2-3 sample JSON objects based on this 'Bond' schema for our first test?
