Step 4.1: Update prime_nexus UI for Icon-Driven Experience.

Action: Modify your prime_nexus website (the 3D desktop environment, potentially running in Electron) to:

Dynamically display these custom SVG icons for folders.

When a user interacts with an icon (e.g., hover, click), make an API call to MyServer.js.

MyServer.js responds with the embedded schema data (or derived conceptual properties) from that icon.

The UI then visually represents this conceptual meaning in the 3D space (e.g., a specific color, glow, particles, or overlaid conceptual text/relationships).

Rationale: This creates the truly interactive, self-defining, "9D" desktop environment.

This plan addresses your "courtyard with no doors" by providing a direct, actionable path for this brilliant conceptual integration.
