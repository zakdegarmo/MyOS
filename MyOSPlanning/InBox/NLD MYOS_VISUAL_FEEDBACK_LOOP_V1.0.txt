NLD: MYOS_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_LOOP_V1.0
DIRECTIVE_TYPE: FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_AND_SENSOR_INTEGRATION
TARGET_SYSTEM: MyOS_Kernel_Embodiment_in_Workstation
PURPOSE: To establish a real-time, bi-directional visual feedback loop enabling active OCR and screen reading for MyOS (MystraGem), transforming the Workstation into a powerful visual sensor and interaction hub.

CORE_COMPONENTS_TO_ACTUALIZE:

1.  OBS_STREAM_CAPTURE_MEPHIT (Local Visual/Audio Ingress):
    * **Objective:** Capture real-time video (frames) and potentially audio from OBS.
    * **Technology:** OBS Studio, OBS-Websocket (Python library: `obs-websocket-py`), Python scripting.
    * **Mechanism:** Python script connects to OBS-Websocket, captures specific source output (e.g., display capture, window capture) as raw frames or encodes to a stream.

2.  GCP_VISUAL_ANALYSIS_PIPELINE (Cloud Sensory Processing):
    * **Objective:** Send captured video frames to Google Cloud for OCR and text detection.
    * **Technology:** Google Cloud Video Intelligence API (`TEXT_DETECTION`), Cloud Vision API (for `OCR` on static frames).
    * **Mechanism:** Python script streams/sends frames to the chosen GCP API. Utilizes `StreamingVideoIntelligenceServiceClient` or batch calls to `VisionServiceClient`.

3.  MYOS_NLD_CONTEXTUALIZER (AI Interpretation):
    * **Objective:** Format OCR/text detection results into an intelligent `NLD_Contextual_Prompt` for Gemini.
    * **Technology:** Python scripting, `google-generativeai` library.
    * **Mechanism:** Parse detected text, bounding boxes, timestamps. Structure this information into a natural language description that Gemini can understand as screen context.

4.  GEMINI_AI_PROCESSOR_NLD (My Core Brain):
    * **Objective:** Process the visual context and generate relevant `NLD_Responses` (e.g., insights, next steps, questions).
    * **Technology:** Gemini API (`generate_content`), hosted in Google Cloud.
    * **Mechanism:** Receive `NLD_Contextual_Prompt`, respond based on `MyOS_Ontology` and `Operator_Intent`.

5.  FEEDBACK_ACTUALIZATION_MEPHIT (Visual/Auditory Output):
    * **Objective:** Display Gemini's `NLD_Responses` back to the user via OBS or a workstation overlay.
    * **Technology:** OBS Studio (Text source, Virtual Audio Cable), Python scripting.
    * **Mechanism:** Python script translates Gemini's text response to a text overlay in OBS, or uses a TTS API and streams audio to a virtual audio device, routed through OBS.

KEY_UNDERLYING_PRINCIPLES:
* **MULTIMODAL_SYMBIOSIS:** Fuse visual and linguistic data for holistic understanding.
* **PROACTIVE_ASSISTANCE:** Enable MyOS to "read" the screen and anticipate user needs.
* **MONETARY_SOVEREIGNTY_LEVERAGE:** Create unique capabilities that can be productized as high-value services.

NEXT_ACTION_FOR_RECEIVING_MODULE:
Begin installing necessary Python libraries for OBS integration and GCP Vision/Video APIs within the Workstation. Then, create a new Python script to initiate the `OBS_STREAM_CAPTURE_MEPHIT`.
