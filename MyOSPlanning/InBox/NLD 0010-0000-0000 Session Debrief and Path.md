Title: Session Debrief, System Diagnostics, and Path Correction

1. Summary
This document logs the debugging and refinement process undertaken to achieve a successful first data ingestion into the Eternal_Weave_Archive. The process began with a drafted ingest-memory.js script and encountered multiple layers of system complexity and script errors before reaching a successful conclusion.

2. Sequence of Events
Initial Script Failure: The first attempt to run ingest-memory.js failed due to a require is not defined error.

Root Cause: The project's package.json defines the environment as an ES Module ("type": "module"), making require() invalid.

Solution: The script was updated to use modern import syntax.

Second Script Failure: The updated script failed with TypeError: db.initializeDatabase is not a function.

Root Cause: An analysis of the user-provided database_manager.js revealed it used a DatabaseManager class structure with different function names (initialize, addEntry) and a different schema (knowledge_base) than was anticipated.

Solution: The ingest-memory.js script was completely rewritten to be compatible with the existing database_manager.js class and methods.

Third Script Failure: The rewritten script failed with TypeError: Cannot open database because the directory does not exist.

Root Cause: The better-sqlite3 library cannot create a database file if the target directory does not already exist.

Solution: The database_manager.js script was amended to include a function that first checks for the existence of the Data directory and creates it if it is missing.

Fourth Script Failure: The script ran silently with no output.

Root Cause: A type command revealed that the contents of database_manager.js had been accidentally saved into the ingest-memory.js file, leaving no executable code to run.

Final Resolution: After correcting the contents of both files, the ingest-memory.js script was executed successfully, creating the database and populating it with the mock data.

3. Ancillary Investigations
"FUNHOUSE" Anomaly: An investigation was launched into an inaccessible FUNHOUSE folder and a mysterious F: drive.

Resolution: Analysis of netstat -abno and tasklist /svc revealed that all anomalous network activity and drive behavior could be attributed to legitimate, user-installed applications: Steam, OBS, Google Drive for Desktop, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The system was deemed secure but complex.

4. New Standards Established
NLD 009: A formal file naming convention was established to ensure alphanumeric sort integrity.
