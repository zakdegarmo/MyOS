This directory contains different kinds of sorts, and in some cases
variants of writing the same sorting method.

The subdirectories are:
 -- (2) BatcherSort: An implementation of Batcher's Sorting Algorithm,
and an additional implementation that is to be more fine-grained.

 -- BubbleSort: An implementation of BubbleSort, where the maximum
    elements found so far "bubble" up to the top of the tape.
    Fine-Grained; input = 1; output = 1.

 -- ComparisonCounting: An implementation of Comparison Counting.
    This algorithm performs an N-way split of N elements.  Each path
    through the split-join calculates the ordered index for each of
    the N elements by comparing it to every other element.

 -- InsertionSort: An implementation of Insertion Sorting.  More
    complicated than straight insertion sort to try and reduce number
    of reorderings.

 -- MergeSort: An implementation of Merge Sort.

 -- RadixSort: An implementation of binary radix sort.  Each
    successive filter sorts on a different bit.
